# Gold Standard

A muted take on black and gold, in light and dark.

## Quick Start

Via the [VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wxlfe.gold-standard), Gold Standard can be installed in a single click.

It's also searchable there by name!

## Contributing

While this is more of a personal side project, if you use the theme and find an issue, feel free to open an issue or offer changes. I don't use every language or framework, so there are many environments I'll never see this theme used in, but I'd much prefer it be usable there nevertheless.

## Packaging & Publishing

To package, run `vsce package`.

Then, publish by running `vsce publish [ patch | minor | major ]`
