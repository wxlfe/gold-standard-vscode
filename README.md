# Gold Standard

A simple pair of themes both light and dark making use of a color palette of charcoal, off-white, and muted gold.

## Quick Start

Once the themes have reached a usable state, I'll make them available in the VS Code Extension Marketplace. As of now, they aren't listed just yet.

## Contributing

While this is more of a personal side project, if you use the theme and find an issue, feel free to offer changes. I don't use every language or framework, so there are many environments I'll never see this theme used in, but I'd much prefer it be usable there nevertheless.
